## This is a markdown file


** Markdown is awesome! **

There are a few flavors of Markdown, so you need to be aware which version your tool supports.

- [Original specification](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) by John Gruber of [DaringFireball.net](http://daringfireball.net/) fame
- [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) is an improved version that GitHub uses. Its best feature is support for language-specific syntax coloring!
- [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org) is a community attempt to create an unambiguous spec for the language.
